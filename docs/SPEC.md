# lintAmigo – Specification

> Lint your CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, Cursor rules and Copilot instructions.
> Catch stale paths, dead commands and leaked secrets before your agent reads them.

Status: v0.1 spec, updated for the v0.1.1 rename on 2026-09-15. Owner: Amerigo Velletti. Implementation: Codex. Review: Claude.

Product name: **lintAmigo**. npm package and CLI: `lintamigo`. GitHub repository:
`Amerigo2020/lintamigo`. The former `amigolint` configuration and suppression
names remain accepted for migration; new output and generated configuration
use `lintamigo`.

The `lintamigo` package also exposes an `amigolint` binary alias for existing
local scripts. Package dependencies and programmatic imports use `lintamigo`;
the old npm package remains a separate historical artifact.

## 1. Problem

Agent instruction files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) rot faster than code. Nobody runs them, so nothing fails when a referenced file is renamed, a script is removed, or the file grows to 10k tokens that get injected into every request. Real example from the author's own repo on 2026-09-02: `CLAUDE.md` referenced six `.claude/skills/gitnexus/*/SKILL.md` files that did not exist.

lintAmigo is `eslint` for those files: fast, zero-config, no LLM required, runs in CI.

## 2. Non-goals (v0.x)

- No LLM calls by default. An optional `--ai` mode may come in v0.3, never required.
- No auto-rewrite of prose. `--fix` only for mechanically safe fixes (v0.2).
- Not a formatter. Markdown style is out of scope.

## 3. Tech stack

| Concern | Choice | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Language | TypeScript 5.x, strict, ESM only | matches author's stack |
| Runtime | Node >= 20 | `fs.glob` not yet stable in 20, use `tinyglobby` |
| Package manager | pnpm | |
| Bundler | `tsdown` (single `dist/cli.mjs`, shebang) | fast, zero-config |
| CLI parsing | `commander` | well known, tiny |
| Colors | `picocolors` | 0 deps |
| Globbing | `tinyglobby` | small, respects ignore patterns |
| YAML frontmatter | `yaml` | for `.mdc` and `SKILL.md` |
| Tests | `vitest` | |
| Lint/format | `biome` | matches author's stack |
| Tokens | heuristic `Math.ceil(chars / 3.6)` labelled "≈" in output | exact tokenizer is 2 MB; add `--exact-tokens` via optional `gpt-tokenizer` in v0.2 |

Hard rule: install size under 2 MB, cold `npx lintamigo` under 5 s on a 10k-file repo. Measure in CI.

## 4. Discovery: which files are linted

Default targets are searched from the repo root (the nearest ancestor with `.git`, else cwd). Exclude `.git`, dependency/output/cache/virtual-environment directories (`node_modules`, `vendor`, `dist`, `build`, `out`, `target`, `coverage`, `.next`, `.turbo`, `.cache`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`, `venv`), and anything in `.gitignore` (use `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard` when Git is available, with a tinyglobby static-ignore fallback):

AL001 may keep an auxiliary view of `@scope` subtrees under `vendor` solely to
disambiguate scoped-package path references. These entries never become lint
targets or general file/directory-index entries and cannot provide suggestions.

| Agent | Files | Auto-loaded by agent? |
|-------|-------|------------------------|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `**/CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `.claude/agents/*.md`, `.claude/commands/*.md` | root always; nested by location; skills, agents, and commands lazily |
| Codex | `AGENTS.md`, `**/AGENTS.md`, `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` | root always; nested by location; skills lazily |
| Cursor | `.cursorrules`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | per `alwaysApply`/`globs` |
| Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` | root always; scoped instructions lazily |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` | always |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules`, `.windsurf/rules/*.md` | always |
| Cline / Roo | `.clinerules`, `.clinerules/*.md`, `.roo/rules/*.md` | always |
| Generic | any additional globs from config `include` | |

Nested `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` under `.claude/worktrees/**` are excluded by default (they are copies).

The user can pass explicit paths: `lintamigo CLAUDE.md docs/AGENTS.md`.

## 5. Parsing model

Each file is parsed once into a `Doc`:

```ts
interface Doc {
  path: string;            // repo-relative
  agent: AgentKind;        // 'claude' | 'codex' | 'cursor' | 'copilot' | ...
  raw: string;
  frontmatter?: Record<string, unknown>;  // parsed YAML if file starts with ---
  lines: Line[];           // { n: number, text: string, inCodeBlock: boolean, codeLang?: string }
  codeBlocks: CodeBlock[]; // { startLine, endLine, lang, body }
  inlineCode: Span[];      // backtick spans outside code blocks: { line, col, text }
  links: Link[];           // markdown links and bare URLs: { line, text, target, isLocal }
  imports: Span[];         // Claude Code `@path` imports at line start or after whitespace
  headings: Heading[];
  approxTokens: number;
}
```

Parsing is hand-written (regex + state machine), no markdown AST library. Must handle fenced blocks with ``` and ~~~, nested backticks, and Windows line endings.

Angle-bracket autolinks are links only when their content is an absolute URI or an email address. Link-looking text inside inline code, local anchors, and angle-bracket placeholder destinations are not links.

## 6. Rules

Each rule is a module `src/rules/<id>.ts` exporting:

```ts
interface Rule {
  id: string;                 // kebab-case, e.g. 'stale-path'
  code: string;               // 'AL001'
  defaultSeverity: 'error' | 'warn' | 'info' | 'off';
  docs: string;               // one paragraph, shown by `lintamigo rules`
  check(ctx: RuleContext): Finding[];
}

interface RuleContext {
  doc: Doc;
  allDocs: Doc[];
  repo: RepoIndex;            // file list, package.json scripts, Makefile targets, justfile recipes
  options: Record<string, unknown>;
}

interface Finding {
  rule: string; code: string; severity: Severity;
  file: string; line: number; col?: number; endLine?: number;
  message: string;            // one sentence, no trailing period
  suggestion?: string;        // e.g. "Did you mean `src/api/routes.ts`?"
  fixable?: boolean;
}
```

### AL001 `stale-path` (error)

Detect references to files or directories that do not exist.

Candidates from inline code spans and `@imports` contain a `/` or end with a known extension (`.ts .tsx .js .mjs .cjs .json .md .mdx .yml .yaml .toml .py .go .rs .rb .sh .sql .prisma .env .css .scss .html .txt .lock .csv`). Bare tokens in prose are candidates only when they contain a `/` and either start with `./`, `../`, `~/`, or a dot-directory; their first segment is an existing top-level repository file or directory; or they start with a common source root (`src/`, `apps/`, `packages/`, `docs/`, `test/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, `lib/`). Bare filenames without a slash are not prose candidates.

Exclusions (precision-first):
- URLs and extensionless absolute routes; domains, versions, flags and commands, property or method syntax, quoted/assignment syntax, and bare extension mentions
- angle-bracket or Mustache placeholders, tokens containing an ellipsis (`...` or `…`), and brace groups without a comma (including `{...}`); comma groups such as `{a,b}` remain globs
- tokens containing single or double quotes, including quoted bracket access such as `metadata.annotations['name']`
- CSS arbitrary values, empty bracket syntax, numeric path segments, and inline extensionless slash phrases whose segments are plain `^[a-z0-9-]+$` words (case-insensitive), unless explicitly relative or rooted at an indexed top-level entry
- slash-free wildcard property paths containing `.*` or `*.` when every non-wildcard dot-separated segment is identifier-like and the token has no known file extension; extension-bearing patterns such as `*.json`, `*.test.ts`, and `*.showcase.js` remain globs
- slash-free Go pointer and slice-pointer type tokens beginning with `*` followed by an optional `[]` and dot-separated, letter-led identifiers, when the token has no known file extension
- scoped package tokens (`@scope/...`), including glob forms, unless a directory literally named for the scope exists in the repository; local scoped tokens resolve at any depth, and a missing token under a nested scope is `info` pointing to that scope only when it contains another package directory, otherwise it is skipped
- bare alias prefixes `@/`, `~/`, `./`, and `../` with no path after the prefix
- npm dependency subpaths and `@/` or `~/` aliases when a repository tsconfig defines TypeScript aliases
- tokens containing an index-excluded directory segment: `node_modules`, `vendor`, `dist`, `build`, `out`, `target`, `coverage`, `.next`, `.turbo`, `.cache`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`, or `venv`
- paths ignored by `stalePath.ignore`, bare inline filenames found by basename elsewhere in the repository, or paths resolving from the document directory, repository root, `$HOME` for `~/`, or (for `SKILL.md`) a parent of the skill directory

- Leading-slash candidates resolve from the repository root first, then as absolute filesystem paths; report only when both miss
- For a missing candidate with at least two segments, a segment-aligned repository suffix match is `info`: "`src/HIR/` does not exist here; found at `compiler/packages/babel-plugin-react-compiler/src/HIR`"; prefer the shortest path and index lazily by final segment

Glob characters are `*`, `?`, `[`, and comma-bearing brace groups. A glob without a slash is matched as `**/<glob>` at every depth; a glob with a slash is matched as written relative to both the document directory and repository root. Scoped-package paths and globs are always matched as `**/<token>`. Match against files and directories and report "glob matches no files" only when neither matches.

For an extensionless path beginning with `./` or `../`, also probe `.ts .tsx .js .jsx .mjs .cjs .mts .cts .py .md` and `/index.<ext>`. If none resolves, report it as `info`.

For a missing single-segment directory reference such as `core/`, do not use fuzzy suggestions. If the same directory basename exists elsewhere, report `info` with "`core/` does not exist here; found at `front_end/core`"; otherwise retain the normal severity and "does not exist" message.

Suggestion: for inline code and `@imports`, prefer the same basename in another directory, breaking ties by the smallest full-path Levenshtein distance. Otherwise fuzzy match basenames of at least four characters, with maximum distance 1 for basenames of five characters or fewer and 2 for longer basenames. Single-segment directory references use the special handling above. At most one suggestion. Prose findings do not receive suggestions.

Severity note: candidates from prose (not inline code) are reported as `warn`, not `error`, because false positives are more likely there. A missing bare filename in inline code is first searched by basename across the repository, then reported as `warn` with "does not exist anywhere in the repo" because its intended location is ambiguous.

### AL002 `stale-script` (error)

Detect commands that reference non-existent package scripts or make/just targets.

Patterns (inline code and code blocks with lang `bash|sh|zsh|shell|console|` empty):
- `npm run <s>`, `npm test` (requires `test` script), `pnpm <s>`, `pnpm run <s>`, `yarn <s>`, `yarn run <s>`, `bun run <s>`
- `yarn workspace <pkg> <script>`, `pnpm --filter <pkg> <script>`, `pnpm -F <pkg> <script>`, `npm -w <pkg> run <script>`, `npm --workspace <pkg> run <script>` resolve against a workspace package's `name`; unknown packages are skipped
- `yarn workspaces foreach ...` is skipped because it does not identify one package
- `make <target>` → Makefile targets (regex `^([a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+):` excluding `.PHONY`)
- `just <recipe>` → justfile
- `turbo run <task>` → `turbo.json` tasks (pipeline or tasks key)

- Scan inline code and non-comment lines of shell code blocks; strip from the first unquoted `#`, and never parse prose outside inline code
- Skip candidate tokens containing `<`, `>`, `{`, `}`, `$`, `...`, or `…`; these are placeholders, not script or target names
- Treat `bun <file>`, `bun run <file>`, `node <file>`, `npx tsx <file>`, and `deno run <file>` as file references when the file argument contains `/` or ends with a file extension; AL001 owns file existence checks
- Skip `pnpm install|add|remove|dlx|exec|create|i|up|why|ls|-v|--version` and the same set for npm/yarn/bun
- Also skip `bun x`, `bunx`, `bun update|test|build|init|pm`, and `bun --<flag>`
- Bare `yarn <name>`, `pnpm <name>`, and `bun <name>` may invoke binaries; skip repository dependencies and names in `node_modules/.bin`
- Skip `the`, `a`, `an`, `to`, `and`, `or`, `it`, `all`, `run`, `sure`, `use`, `do`, and `not` as make targets or just recipes
- Resolve `package.json` from the document directory upward; workspace-only scripts are `info` with "script only exists in packages/x"

### AL003 `broken-import` (error)

- Claude Code `@path` imports: line-start or whitespace-preceded `@` followed by a path-like token. Must resolve relative to the doc or `~`. Ignore `@scope/pkg` npm names (no `/` after a dot-free scope? rule: skip if token matches `^@[\w-]+/[\w.-]+$` and does not exist on disk AND `node_modules/<token>` exists or the token has no extension).
- `.mdc` frontmatter `globs`: each glob must match at least one file.
- `SKILL.md`: frontmatter `name` must equal its directory name (Claude Code convention) → `warn`.

### AL004 `secret-leak` (error)

Instruction files are sent to LLM providers on every request. Patterns:

| Name | Regex |
|------|-------|
| AWS access key | `AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}` |
| OpenAI / Anthropic style | `\bsk-(?:ant-)?[A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}` |
| GitHub token | `\bgh[pousr]_[A-Za-z0-9]{36,}` |
| Slack token | `\bxox[baprs]-[A-Za-z0-9-]{10,}` |
| Private key block | `-----BEGIN (?:RSA |EC |OPENSSH )?PRIVATE KEY-----` |
| Generic assignment | `(?i)(api[_-]?key|secret|token|password)\s*[:=]\s*["']?[A-Za-z0-9_\-]{16,}` |
| JWT | `\beyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]{10,}\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]{10,}\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]{10,}` |
| Database URL with password | `(?:postgres|mysql|mongodb)(?:\+srv)?://[^:\s]+:[^@\s]{4,}@` |

Exclusions: values that are obviously placeholders (`xxx`, `your-`, `<...>`, `example`, `changeme`, `123456`, `sk-...`). Report with the secret masked (first 4 chars + `****`). Never print the full value.

- Generic assignment values require at least 16 characters plus at least three digits, mixed letter case, or at least 24 characters without `-`/`_`; reject lowercase word segments joined only by `-`/`_`
- Provider-specific patterns are unchanged

### AL005 `token-budget` (warn)

Per file: warn above `4000` approx tokens, error above `12000`. Config `tokenBudget: { file: 4000, fileError: 12000, agentTotal: 8000 }`. Lazily loaded files use twice the configured per-file thresholds and are labelled "(lazily loaded)" in findings.
Per agent: sum of files that agent auto-loads at session start (see table in §4, "always" rows plus root + `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for Claude). Lazily loaded files and nested files are excluded. Warn if sum > `agentTotal`. Message includes the total and the three largest contributors.

### AL006 `dead-link` (warn)

Markdown links `[text](target)` and `<target>` where target is local (no scheme, not `#anchor`, not `mailto:`): target must exist (strip `#fragment` and `?query`). HTTP(S) links are only checked with `--check-urls` (HEAD request, 5 s timeout, 8 concurrent, report 4xx/5xx/timeout as `info`).

### AL007 `duplicate-rule` (warn)

Compare non-empty prose lines longer than 40 chars, normalized (lowercase, collapse whitespace, strip markdown bullets/punctuation). Similarity = Sørensen–Dice on word bigrams. Candidate pairs must share at least two bigrams, or one when the line has fewer than six words; implementations must use a bigram index rather than a full pairwise scan. Report similarity >= 0.9 at most once per line, pointing at the second occurrence with "duplicates <file>:<line>". Skip lines inside code blocks and headings.

Cross-file comparison defaults to `crossFile: "auto"`: compare only documents loaded together by the same agent, with nested `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` joining their root group and lazily loaded files comparing only within themselves. `crossFile: "all"` restores repository-wide comparison and `crossFile: "none"` limits comparison to each file.

### AL008 `contradiction` (warn)

Heuristic only, always labelled "possible contradiction". For imperative lines under 300 characters (start with or contain `always|never|must|must not|do not|don't|avoid|prefer|use|only`), extract lowercase content keywords (words >= 4 chars minus stopwords and the modal words above). A candidate needs opposite polarity, at least three shared keywords, and at least one shared keyword occurring in fewer than 5% of all imperative corpus lines. Use the same `crossFile` modes and document groups as AL007. Report only the best-scoring partner per line, at most ten findings per file, with both source lines truncated to 60 characters in the message. Fixture-driven; precision matters more than recall.

### AL009 `vague-rule` (info)

Lines matching weasel patterns: `write (good|clean|quality) code`, `be careful`, `use best practices`, `follow (the )?conventions`, `as appropriate`, `when necessary`, `properly`, `etc\.?$`. Message: "Vague instruction; agents can't act on it. Say what to do instead". Off by default in `--format github` to keep CI quiet? No: keep on, severity info does not fail CI.

### AL010 `missing-essentials` (info)

For root-level docs of each agent: if none of the docs mentions a build, test or lint command (detect `npm|pnpm|yarn|bun|make|cargo|go test|pytest|vitest|jest` inside inline code or code blocks), report once per repo: "No build/test command found in agent instructions".

### AL011 `frontmatter` (error)

- `.mdc`: frontmatter present; at least one of `description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply`. `globs` must be string or string array.
- `SKILL.md` (Claude and Codex): `name` and `description` required; `description` under 1024 chars; name kebab-case.
- `.claude/agents/*.md`: `name`, `description` required; `tools` if present is a comma-separated string or array.
- `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`: `applyTo` required.

### AL012 `nested-override` (info)

A nested `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` that contains >= 3 lines with duplicate-rule similarity to the root file. Message: "Nested file repeats N lines from the root; agents load both".

### AL013 `huge-code-block` (warn)

Code block longer than 40 lines. Message: "Code block of N lines; link to the file instead of inlining it".

### AL014 `todo-marker` (info)

`TODO|FIXME|TBD|XXX|WIP` outside code blocks.

### AL015 `absolute-user-path` (warn)

Paths containing `/Users/<name>/` or `/home/<name>/` or `C:\Users\`. Message: "Machine-specific path; other contributors and CI won't have it".

## 7. Inline suppression

- `<!-- lintamigo-disable-next-line stale-path -->` suppresses the next non-blank line.
- `<!-- lintamigo-disable stale-path, dead-link -->` from here to end of file or until `<!-- lintamigo-enable -->`.
- `<!-- lintamigo-disable-file -->` at top.
Suppressed findings are counted and shown in the summary line ("3 suppressed").

The legacy `amigolint-` prefix remains accepted for all four directives with
the same behavior. New examples and generated content use `lintamigo-`.

## 8. Configuration

Lookup order, first available source wins:

1. Explicit `--config <path>`
2. `lintamigo.config.json`
3. `.lintamigorc.json`
4. `package.json#lintamigo`
5. Legacy `amigolint.config.json`
6. Legacy `.amigolintrc.json`
7. Legacy `package.json#amigolint`

Merge only the selected source over defaults, not multiple sources together.
New names take precedence over every legacy source. Schema (also shipped as
`schema.json` for editor completion):

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Amerigo2020/lintamigo/main/schema.json",
  "include": ["docs/agents/*.md"],          // additional globs
  "exclude": ["**/fixtures/**"],
  "rules": {
    "stale-path": "error",
    "vague-rule": "off",
    "token-budget": ["warn", { "file": 6000, "agentTotal": 10000 }],
    "stale-path": ["error", { "ignore": ["/api/**"] }]
  },
  "checkUrls": false
}
```

`lintamigo init` writes `lintamigo.config.json` with all rules at default and
a comment per rule. Refuse to create it when any recognized new or legacy
configuration file or package key already exists, to prevent overwriting or
shadowing existing settings.

## 9. CLI

```
lintamigo [paths...]                 lint (default command)
  --format pretty|json|sarif|github  default pretty; github emits ::error/::warning workflow commands
  --config <file>
  --rule <id>[,<id>]                 only run these rules
  --max-warnings <n>                 exit 1 when exceeded
  --check-urls
  --quiet                            errors only
  --no-color
lintamigo init                       write lintamigo.config.json
lintamigo rules [--format md]        table of rules, codes, default severity, one-line docs
lintamigo stats                      per-agent always-loaded/on-demand file and token totals, largest file
lintamigo --version / --help
```

Exit codes: `0` no errors (warnings allowed unless `--max-warnings`), `1` findings at error level, `2` runtime/config error.

Pretty output (one file block per file, ESLint-like):

```
CLAUDE.md
  12:14  error  stale-path   `.claude/skills/gitnexus/gitnexus-cli/SKILL.md` does not exist
  40:3   warn   token-budget file is ≈4.9k tokens (limit 4k)
  55:1   info   vague-rule   "follow best practices" is not actionable

✖ 1 error, 1 warning, 1 info in 3 files (≈9.2k tokens across agent instructions)
```

JSON output: `{ version, root, files: [{ path, agent, approxTokens }], findings: Finding[], summary: { errors, warnings, infos, suppressed } }`.
SARIF 2.1.0 with one `rule` entry per rule so GitHub Code Scanning renders it.

## 10. Architecture

```
src/
  cli.ts              commander setup, exit codes
  index.ts            programmatic API: lint({ root, paths?, config? }): Promise<Report>
  config.ts           load + validate config (zod), defaults
  discover.ts         target file discovery (§4)
  parse.ts            Doc parser (§5)
  repo-index.ts       file list, scripts, make targets, just recipes, workspaces; cached per run
  rules/index.ts      registry
  rules/<id>.ts       one rule per file
  report/pretty.ts, json.ts, sarif.ts, github.ts
  tokens.ts           approx tokens
  suppress.ts         inline comments
test/
  fixtures/<rule>/repo/...   a mini repo per rule
  fixtures/<rule>/expected.json
  rules/<id>.test.ts
  cli.test.ts                 spawns the built CLI, checks exit codes and formats
  perf.test.ts                generates a 10k-file tree, asserts < 3 s lint time
```

Programmatic API is public and documented so editors / other tools can embed it.

## 11. Milestones and acceptance criteria

### M0 – Skeleton (0.5 day)
- Repo scaffold: pnpm, TS strict, biome, vitest, tsdown, `bin` entry, GitHub Actions CI (node 20 + 22, macOS + ubuntu), MIT license, `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `lintamigo --version` works via `npx` from a packed tarball (`pnpm pack` in CI, install into temp dir, run).
- Acceptance: CI green; `pnpm build` produces a single `dist/cli.mjs` under 200 kB.

### M1 – Core: discovery, parser, repo index, AL001, AL002, pretty + json output (2 days)
- Acceptance: fixtures for AL001 (12 cases incl. all exclusions listed in §6) and AL002 (8 cases) pass; running against the author's Fyndl repo reports the six missing gitnexus SKILL.md paths and zero false positives on `/health`, `/version`, `request.body`, `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze`, `.agents/skills/**` (glob that must be checked as glob).
- Exit codes correct. `--format json` validated against a JSON schema in tests.
- Full lint of a generated repository with 10,000 files and 30 instruction files containing 600 missing inline paths completes in under 3 s.

### M2 – Rules AL003 to AL008, AL011, suppression, config (2 days)
- Acceptance: each rule has >= 6 fixture cases (3 positive, 3 negative-looking-positive). Config loading with rule overrides tested. Inline suppression tested.
- AL004 never prints a full secret (test asserts masking).

### M3 – Remaining rules, sarif + github formats, `stats`, `rules`, `init` (1.5 days)
- Acceptance: SARIF validated with the official schema in tests; `--format github` produces annotations visible in a real PR of the repo itself (dogfood workflow `.github/workflows/lint-instructions.yml`).

### M4 – Polish for launch (2 days)
- Install size measured in CI and printed.
- README per LAUNCH.md checklist; `examples/broken-repo/` with a deliberately bad CLAUDE.md; `vhs` tape in `demo/demo.tape`; GIF committed.
- `scripts/study.ts` for the "State of CLAUDE.md" study (clone 100 repos shallow, run lint, aggregate to `study/results.json` + markdown table).
- `v0.1.1` tagged, `lintamigo` published with `npm publish --provenance` via GitHub Actions on tag.
- Rename acceptance: the package, binary, README, API import, schemas, reports,
  and launch assets use the new identity; config discovery follows §8 and
  legacy suppression comments retain their behavior from §7.

## 13. Roadmap after launch (for README)

- v0.2: `--fix` for dead links and stale paths with a unique suggestion; exact tokenizer; `--watch`.
- v0.3: `--ai` mode (optional, bring your own API key) for contradiction and vagueness with explanations; VS Code extension using the programmatic API.
- v0.4: rule packs per agent, e.g. Claude-specific advice on `@import` structure.
